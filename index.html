    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Michigan, and I will be graduating in Fall 2025. I declared an English major in Fall 2023, and declared Computer
    Science as a double major in Fall 2024. I had my first coding experience when I enrolled in EECS 183, Elementary Programming, in Winter 2024 after completing the
    requirements for my English major. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and felt motivated to pursue Computer Science alongside my existing English major. While
    taking EECS 183, I had the opportunity to participate in the EECS 183 Showcase at the end of the semester, where my groupmates and I shared our work on making
    an automated player to a game involving elevators. We were awarded a showcase award for our work, and I was further motivated to pursue a career in programming.</p>
    <p>Discovering my passion for programming in the second semester of my junior year led me to fast-track my progress toward the Computer Science major, so I
    completed EECS 280, NAME, and EECS 203, over the spring semester of 2024 and just recently completed EECS 281 and EECS 376 during the semester of Fall 2024.
    I am now planning to take courses in website development, software engineering, and more during the Winter 2025 semester, which will allow me to graduate in the
    Fall of 2025. </p>
    <p>I am hoping to participate in a software engineering internship during the summer of 2025, and I am currently seeking positions!
    <br>Thank you again for visiting my website,
    <br>Please contact me at chriada@umich.edu with any concerns.
    <br>Thank you!</p>
